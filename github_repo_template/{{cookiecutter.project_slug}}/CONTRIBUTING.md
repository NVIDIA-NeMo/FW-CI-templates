## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher (up to 3.13)
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python package management
- Git for version control

### Setup

1. **Install UV**

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Set up development environment**

   ```bash
   uv sync --all-extras
   ```

4. **Install pre-commit hooks**

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

### Development Tools

The project uses the following tools for development:

- **UV**: Fast Python package installer and resolver
- **Ruff**: Code formatting and linting
- **MyPy**: Static type checking
- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks for code quality

## Code Style and Quality

### Formatting

We use Ruff for consistent code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code manually
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Or run pre-commit to format and check everything
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Type Checking

We enforce strict type checking with MyPy. All public functions and methods must have type annotations.

### Code Quality Guidelines

1. **Follow Python conventions**: Use PEP 8 style guidelines (enforced by the linting tool above)
2. **Type annotations**: All public APIs must have complete type annotations
3. **Documentation**: Add docstrings for all public classes and methods
4. **Error handling**: Use explicit error handling with appropriate exception types
5. **Testing**: Write tests for new functionality and bug fixes
6. **Logging**: Use structured logging via `structlog` instead of print statements

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_specific_module.py

# Run tests without network access (default)
uv run pytest --disable-network
```

### Test Structure

- Unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory
- Test files should follow the naming pattern `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Group related tests in classes when appropriate
- Mock external dependencies and network calls

### Writing Tests

1. **Test coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for core functionality
2. **Test isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on others
3. **Clear assertions**: Use descriptive assertion messages
4. **Mock external dependencies**: Use `pytest` fixtures and mocking for external services

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. **Create an issue**: For significant changes, create an issue first to discuss the approach
2. **Branch naming**: Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-new-exporter`, `fix/memory-leak`)
3. **Code quality**: Ensure all checks pass:

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   uv run pytest
   ```

### PR Requirements

1. **Clear description**: Explain what the PR does and why
2. **Tests**: Include tests for new functionality or bug fixes
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation if needed
4. **Type safety**: Ensure MyPy passes without errors
5. **Backwards compatibility**: Avoid breaking changes unless necessary

### PR Process

1. **Fork the repository**: External contributors should fork the repository to their GitHub account
2. **Clone and branch**: Clone your fork and create a feature branch from `main`
3. **Make changes**: Implement your changes with tests
4. **Test thoroughly**: Run the full test suite
5. **Push to fork**: Push your branch to your forked repository
6. **Submit PR**: Create a pull request from your fork's branch to the main repository
7. **Address feedback**: Respond to review comments
8. **Squash commits**: Clean up commit history before merging

## Adding New Features

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check the README and inline documentation
- **Issues**: Search existing issues before creating new ones
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub discussions for questions
- **Code Review**: Ask for help in pull request comments

## Communication

- **Issues**: Use GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub discussions for questions and general discussion
- **Pull Requests**: Use PRs for code contributions with clear descriptions

## Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```

  Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

  By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

  (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
      have the right to submit it under the open source license
      indicated in the file; or

  (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
      of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
      license and I have the right under that license to submit that
      work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
      by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
      permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
      in the file; or

  (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
      person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
      it.

  (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
      are public and that a record of the contribution (including all

## ðŸš€ Running GitHub CI

There are two ways to trigger CI tests on your pull request:

### Automatic CI Triggering

If your GitHub user is configured to use [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification), CI tests will run automatically when you push commits to your pull request.

> **Note**: Signed commits are different from signing-off on commits (which uses the `-s` flag mentioned in the [Signing Your Work](#signing-your-work) section).

### Manual CI Triggering

If you don't have signed commits set up, you can still trigger CI tests manually by commenting on your pull request:

```
/ok to test <commit-SHA>
```

For example:

```
/ok to test a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

**Important**: You'll need to add this comment for each new commit you push to ensure CI tests run on the latest changes.

#### Finding Your Commit SHA

You can find the commit SHA in several ways:

- View your pull request's commit history on GitHub
- Run `git log --oneline -1` in your local repository
- Check the commit details in your Git client
